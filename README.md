# Face Movement Tracker

## Overview

Face Movement Tracker is a Python-based project that monitors the duration a person spends in front of a camera by tracking their face movements. This can be used for various applications such as productivity tracking, screen time analysis, or security monitoring.

## Features

*   Real-time face detection using OpenCV and dlib/MediaPipe.
*   Tracks the duration a person remains in front of the camera.
*   Logs entry and exit timestamps.
*   Optional data visualization for monitoring trends.

## Technologies Used

*   Python
*   OpenCV (for face detection and tracking)
*   face_recognition (dlib based, for facial recognition)
*   NumPy (for data processing)
*   pandas (for data handling, e.g., `log.csv`)
*   Matplotlib (for data visualization)
*   TensorFlow (potentially, as listed in `requirements.txt`, though primary use in `main.py` is `face_recognition`)

## Installation

For detailed installation instructions, please see the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file.

## Usage

This project has two main scripts: `main.py` for tracking and logging face time, and `maingraph.py` for visualizing the logged data.

### Running `main.py` (Face Tracking and Logging)

This script performs real-time face detection and recognition to log the time a known individual spends in front of the webcam.

*   **How to run:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

*   **Configuration for `main.py`:**
    *   **Image Path for Known Faces:** The script needs a directory of images to learn and recognize known faces.
        *   You **must** update the `path` variable in `main.py` to point to your directory of known face images.
        *   Detailed instructions for setting up this directory and configuring the path are in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) (Section 6).
    *   **Primary User Recognition:** The script currently contains specific logic to identify a primary user named "Siddharth" (e.g., `siddharth_image_path = next((f'{path}/{cl}' for cl in myList if cl.startswith('Siddharth')), None)`).
        *   If you are not Siddharth, or if you want to specifically track a different individual as the primary recognized person, you will need to modify this part of the script or ensure your primary user's image filename starts with "Siddharth".
        *   For recognizing multiple *distinct* known individuals beyond this primary one with specific logging, the script would require further modifications.
    *   **Log File:** The script generates and appends to a file named `log.csv`. This file records "Entered" and "Exited" timestamps for the recognized primary user.

*   **Operation:**
    *   When you run `python main.py`, a window will open showing your webcam feed.
    *   If a known face (especially the primary configured one) is detected, it will be marked, and logging will commence.
    *   To stop the script and close the webcam window, press the 'q' key while the OpenCV window is active.

### Running `maingraph.py` (Visualizing Logged Data)

This script reads the `log.csv` file (generated by `main.py`) and creates a bar chart showing the total "Up Time" and "Down Time" for each name found in the log.

*   **How to run:**
    ```bash
    python maingraph.py
    ```

*   **Input:**
    *   It requires the `log.csv` file to be present in the same directory. This file should contain columns like `NAME`, `STATUS` ('Entered'/'Exited'), and `TIME`.

*   **Output:**
    *   A Matplotlib window will display a bar chart.
    *   For each `NAME` in the log, two bars are shown: one for total "Up Time" and one for total "Down Time".
    *   The height of the bars indicates the duration in **seconds**.
    *   The chart is titled "Up and Down Time Analysis" with X-axis as "Name" and Y-axis as "Time (seconds)".

## Future Enhancements

*   Add support for multiple face tracking with distinct logging.
*   Improve accuracy using deep learning models.
*   Web-based dashboard for visualization.
*   More robust configuration options (e.g., via a config file instead of hardcoding).
