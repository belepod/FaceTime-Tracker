Face Movement Tracker

Overview

Face Movement Tracker is a Python-based project that monitors the duration a person spends in front of a camera by tracking their face movements. This can be used for various applications such as productivity tracking, screen time analysis, or security monitoring.

Features

Real-time face detection using OpenCV and dlib/MediaPipe.

Tracks the duration a person remains in front of the camera.

Logs entry and exit timestamps.

Optional data visualization for monitoring trends.

Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV (for face detection and tracking)

dlib/MediaPipe (for facial landmark detection)

NumPy (for data processing)

Matplotlib (for data visualization)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/belepod/FaceTime-Tracker
cd face-movement-tracker

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Run the script:

python main.py
python maingraph.py

The script will start tracking and logging the duration for which a face is detected.

Press q to stop tracking and view the results.

Configuration

You can adjust parameters like face detection sensitivity and logging frequency in main.py.

Future Enhancements

Add support for multiple face tracking.

Improve accuracy using deep learning models.

Web-based dashboard for visualization.
